Every benchmark has a bash script file to run the benchmark in loop and obtain all the data (with and without hyperthreading) as asked in the assignement.
The name of the run file will be as vs1.sh for the first benchmark and similar for the others.
All the results for each benchmark will be stored in a file results.txt inside the same benchmark folder.
All the benchmark folders will have a c code file which contains the c code to clear the cache. 
The c code file is named viraj.c
You are just required to run the vs1.sh file using the command "bash vs1.sh" in the terminal and all the results will automatically generated in the results.txt file.
Also, the run file will run the c code between everyn run to clear the cache. (you are not requried to run it externally).
The output files generated generated by me during my run can be found inside the directory sample outputs.
